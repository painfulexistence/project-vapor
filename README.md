The goal of this project is a quest for knowledge about modern 3D game engines. It's a deep dive into game engine architecture and current-gen rendering techniques (specifically, hybrid rendering techniques) and a solo journey to design and implement various aspects of a 3D game engine. Aside from personal learning, I'd also like to share knowledge with those learning to make engines.
