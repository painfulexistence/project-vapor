<p>A modern 3D renderer built from scratch with C++ and Metal/Vulkan. </p>
<p>Project Vapor is my deep dive into game engine architecture and current-gen rendering techniques, specifically GPU-driven rendering and hybrid rendering. It's a solo journey where I design and to implement various aspects of a modern 3D game engine. </p>
<p>Aside from personal learning, I'd also like to share knowledge with those learning to make engines! </p>
