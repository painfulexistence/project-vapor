<p>The goal of this project is a quest for knowledge about modern 3D game engines. </p>
<p>It's a deep dive into game engine architecture and current-gen rendering techniques (specifically, hybrid rendering techniques) and a solo journey to design and to implement various aspects of a 3D game engine. </p>
<p>Aside from personal learning, I'd also like to share knowledge with those learning to make engines. </p>
